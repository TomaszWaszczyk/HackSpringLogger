HackSpringLogger
================

1. How to run the code ? 
1.1 Eclipse -> Import -> Git (download successful)
1.2 Right click on project -> Delete (but NOT from a disk, only from Eclipse's workspace)
1.3 Eclipse -> Import -> As existing maven project.
1.4 Right click on project -> Debug as -> Debug on server.
1.5 Done ;-)

Logger with Spring hacked.




Thanks to the code you can avoid such a like of code:

private static final org.slf4j.Logger log = org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomerController2.class);
